		<h2>Sources</h2>
        <p>We identified two datasets that we used to demonstrate the relationship between working poverty and labor rights. </p>
		<p>The first is the <a href="https://ilostat.ilo.org/topics/working-poor/#">International Labor Organization’s working poverty rate data</a>. In this dataset, the ILO provides the percentage of the working population that is impoverished in the global south; the ILO uses the World Bank standard of $1.90 a day as the poverty line, with less than $1.90 per day being categorized as “extremely poor,” $1.90 to $3.20 per day moderately poor, and $3.20 to $5.50 a day near poor.</p>
		<p>The second dataset is <a href="https://www.dept.psu.edu/liberalarts/WorkersRights/about">Pennsylvania State University’s Labor Rights Indicators index</a>. The scholars on the project identified 108 indicators of labor rights and 9 sources which documented violations of the rights. They created a scoring method wherein each violation yielded points added to the score, culminating in comprehensive data on indicators of labor rights.</p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>After selecting our sources, we downloaded, cleaned, and consolidated the datasets. This involved removing non-essential variables and non-numerical values, geocoding the data, and combining our two datasets based on common location values.</p>
		<p>We then set out to begin coding and designing our website. Our goal was to make the website spotlight the countries most affected by working poverty and labor rights violations in a way that is interactive and easy to navigate. After several iterations of the design, we chose a map design which had several layers to click through the different rates of extreme, moderate, and near working poverty as designated by the ILO, with the labor rights index remaining fixed for each country regardless of the layer. For the website overall, we focused on creating an easy-to-navigate design to spotlight the story-map.
