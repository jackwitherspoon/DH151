			According to the International Labour Organization, the working poor are employed people who live in households that fall below an accepted poverty line. Poverty is elusive to tackle in developing countries where individuals are employed but are still unable to lift themselves and their families above the poverty threshold. <br><br>
    In the pursuit of a solution, our group wants to explore whether the story of the working poor varies across countries with different standards of labor rights. If so, this points to a potential course of action that can be taken to improve their well-being.

			<!--Instructions for Final Product-->
<p style="font-size: 15 px; font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif; font-weight: 300;">There are three layers on the map to visualize how much of the working class are extremely poor, moderately poor or near poor. We use opaque circle markers that vary in size according to percentage.

Hover over or click on each circle to see the name of the country and its Labor Index Score, assigned by the <a href="https://www.dept.psu.edu/liberalarts/WorkersRights/about">University of Pennsylvania</a>.
<br>
<br>
We have also highlighted case studies of countries that tell interesting stories about the link between working poverty and labor rights. Featured countries are marked with a star icon on the map. Click on it to explore some hidden narratives.
