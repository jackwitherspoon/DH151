            My name is <b>Jack Witherspoon</b>, and I was born and raised in Redondo Beach, California. Currently I am 21 years old and a senior at UCLA studying economics and accounting. I am also a three-time leukemia survivor. I was first diagnosed with leukemia when he was 2 years old. I finished my treatment when I was 5, but a year later relapsed. After which I underwent another 2 1/2 years of treatment but relapsed again at age 11. To treat his third bout, I underwent a bone marrow transplant. 
            <br>
            <br>During Jack’s treatment I became interested in cooking from watching the Food Network. I entertained himself by cooking at home with my mom and enjoyed dreaming up new recipes. When I was 7 I started hosting charity events to raise money for pediatric leukemia research. So far, I has raised over $150,000, and have established my own endowment at Miller Children’s Hospital and have a patient room named after me there. In 2011 I wrote my own cookbook, published by Chronicle Books, called <i>Twist it Up</i>. Over the years I have also appeared on numerous news shows and national talk shows such as The Tonight Show, The Queen Latifah Show, The Marie Osmond Show and the Home and Family Show.
            <br>
            <br>In 2018 I started my own company called Chef Jack’s. My company makes a baked good called “Skonies” which is a cross between a cookie and a scone. I currently sell them at hospital cafeterias all over Southern California such as UCLA Medical Center, Miller Children’s Hospital, Little Company of Mary Hospital, Torrance Memorial Hospital and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Part of the proceeds from the cookies are donated to my endowment for pediatric leukemia research.
            <br>
            <br>My continued interest in the digital huminites has been due to the interdisciplinary nature of the material. During Digital humanities 151 I hope to learn how to implement web-based technologies such as:
            <ul>
                <li>html</li> 
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>GIS</li>
            </ul> In order to be able to better answer humanities driven questions. Space an time are fundamental to answering questions based in the humanities and with this course I hope to gain the required technical knowledge to more effectively explore those types of questions. In addition, I hope to be able to use the skills I learn in this class to further develop myself professionally.
